# Flight Delay Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **Streamlit-based interactive dashboard** for analyzing flight delays. The application visualizes flight delay patterns and provides insights to optimize flight schedules based on various factors such as airport, weather conditions, and time of day.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview**: View basic information about the dataset, including shape, missing values, and a sample of the data.
- **Delay Distribution**: Explore the overall distribution of flight delays.
- **Delays by Day of the Week**: Visualize average delays by day to identify patterns.
- **Delays by Time of Day**: Analyze average delays based on flight durations (Short, Medium, Long, Very Long).
- **Departure vs. Arrival Delays**: Interactive scatterplot to show the relationship between departure and arrival delays.
- **Impact of Weather**: Heatmap showcasing how weather conditions like wind direction and precipitation affect arrival delays.
- **Download Cleaned Dataset**: Option to download the preprocessed dataset for further analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for interactive visualizations.
- **Backend**: Python with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data processing and visualization.

## Installation

To run this dashboard locally:

   cd repository-name
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
     streamlit run Fligh_Delay_Dashboard2.py

# Dataset

The dashboard uses a dataset named flights_important_features.csv, which contains features such as flight delays, weather conditions, and flight schedules. Make sure this file is in the root directory of the project.
